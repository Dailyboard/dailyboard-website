			<span slot="title">Why Dailyboard?</span>
			 Our story starts with a simple realisation - what separates great teams from
			groups of individuals is a shared plan that maximises their daily output.
		</PageHeader>
		<div class="prose prose-invert">
			<h2>The problem we solve</h2>
			<p>
				We worked in and with multiple teams in the span of our careers. One thing they
				all have in common is that every day they somehow need to decide on the best
				use of the next 24 hours.
			</p>
			<p>
				As teams and companies grow, the dependencies between people become more and
				more common. At some point it's impossible to wrap your head around everything
				you need to take account for in your day plan.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most common scenario is that teams pretend to plan their together, but they
				simply report on their individual goals. It makes daily planning meetings fell
				like they're useless (and in this form - they are) and unexpected roadblocks
				and scheduling conflicts during the day.
			</p>
			<p>
				People waste time switching contexts because noone can review or feedback their
				work and plans blow up because of untracked commitments outside the team.
			</p>
			<p>
				Leaders have hard time supporting the team to be more effective, since their
				commitments are not transparent and it's hard to see where the problems really
				are. And the leaders themselves struggle to plan their day, usually juggling
				between commitments inside and outside their teams.
			</p>

			<h2>The story behind the app</h2>
			<p>
				As we tried to improve our team and the teams we worked with, we started using
				a simple tool to visually jot down all promises that we made at our daily
				planning meetings (called daily stand-ups in the agile development world).
			</p>
			<p>
				The first iteration was a simple whiteboard, divided into days. We simply wrote
				down our commitments - "get X to status Y".
			</p>

			<p>
				We naturally started to improve this experience. We took notes of who made a
				given commitment. We started to break down processes that required multiple
				steps and people to be involved with separate commitments.
			</p>
			<p>
				With the era of remote work, we moved our daily boards to online whiteboards,
				which gave us even more flexibility.
			</p>

			<p>
				Having experience the harmony of working as a true team, we always believed
				there's something more to this idea. Something we can share and scale with a
				dedicated app that would automate the tedious process of copypasting week
				templates. And what's even more important - an app that would sync our
				commitments from different teams/contexts.
			</p>

			<p>That's how an idea for the Dailyboard app came to be.</p>

			<h2>Why does it work?</h2>

			<p>
				There are a few key factors why we believe this daily planning technique
				improves teamwork.
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>Focus on the team.</strong> With everyone managing their own
						"to do lists" in isolation, it's easier to drift away from the team's
						goals.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Transparency.</strong> Everyone's commitments are visible and
						it gives everyone the extra push to focus on what's important for the
						team.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Accountability.</strong> If you commit to bring X to status Y,
						it's easy to verify if it's actually happened. It brings the truth to
						the surface and facilitates more productive conversations.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Spotting roadblocks.</strong> When your team doesn't write down
						commitments in a shared space, it's easy to overcommit or miss the fact
						that more people are actually needed to get something done.
					</li>
				</ol>
			</p>

			<h2>How can you use it in your team?</h2>

			<p>
				The most important thing is - you can start using Dailyboard right away!
				There's not much setup needed - create an organization, invite people and
				create your first shared boards. Everyone can start tracking their commitments
				right away!
			</p>

			<p>
				There are, however, some things you can do to ensure your team's success and
				improve your experience.
			</p>

			<p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<strong>The more, the merrier.</strong> Dailyboard is primarly focused
						on a team's experience. Of course, you can test it on your own, but
						it'll be hard to harness the full potential of the app.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Make it a habit.</strong> Start your daily planning meetings by
						opening Dailyboard. Use it as a team, discuss the plan and make sure
						all commitments are written down.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Use your personal board to focus.</strong> It's great to plan
						your day with everyone you work with, but when you start deviverling
						your commitments, it's time to focus. Use your personal board to cut
						the noise and kick start your day!
					</li>
				</ol>
